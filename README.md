### 2. Project: EASA 

**Description**:  
A centralized storage for approximately 104 different types of immutable information object types and their history such as pilot licences and organizational approvals.

**GitHub Contributions**:
- [[EASA-40] Role concept for access to configuration tables](https://github.tools.sap/easa/easa-repif/pull/71) - Added role-based access control to the configuration service for READ, CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE. Added integration tests for the configuration service to test the role-based access control.
- [[EASA-28] History read API](https://github.tools.sap/easa/easa-repif/pull/90) - Enable uniform history retrieval for all information object types. Introduces endpoints for reading history records via GET operations across the BasicDataService, PersonalDataService, and SensitivePersonalDataService. The implementation allows for list retrieval, as well as detailed entity retrieval by unique identifier. The history records include references to parent objects, enabling further data retrieval in subsequent calls.
- [[EASA-203] holder_insuranceNumber is annotated as sensitive](https://github.tools.sap/easa/easa-repif/pull/93) - Set holder_insuranceNumber field to IsPotentiallyPersonal. Add the rest of the entities and annotate them with personal data annotations.
- [[EASA-220] Roles for information objects - introduce superset behaviour](https://github.tools.sap/easa/easa-repif/pull/101) - A user with the role _read_sensitive is able to also use the personal-data and basic-data endpoints. A user with the role _read_personal is able to also use the basic-data endpoint.
- [[EASA-225] API-SPEC: no endpoint for configuration-data](https://github.tools.sap/easa/easa-repif/pull/110) - Add ConfigurationDataService to API-Spec with url: BASE_URL/v1/api-doc/getConfigurationDataServiceApiDoc()
- [[EASA-192] [SAP Ticket] @Mandatory not reflected in API-Spec](https://github.tools.sap/easa/easa-repif/pull/111) - Latest version of @cds-dk (v8.9.4) provides a fix for the missing @mandatory fields from the required property inside the OpenAPI-Spec
- [[EASA-220] Roles for information objects - introduce superset behaviour](https://github.tools.sap/easa/easa-repif/pull/114) - *Reopend to fix issues with a separate Issue [[EASA-219]](https://github.tools.sap/easa/easa-repif/pull/104)* - Allows personal_access_user and sensitive_access_user to read the basic-data endpoint. Allows sensitive_access_user to read the personal-data and basic-data endpoints.
- [[EASA-33] Only consider relevant search fields of an information object type for searching](https://github.tools.sap/easa/easa-repif/pull/116) - Implements search and filter functionality based on the latest Excel template (-v 16.05.2025) provided by EASA, ensuring that only fields marked as "relevant for search" are considered in $search and $filter operations. It restricts searching and filtering across both Information and History objects.
- [EASA-223] [SAP Internal] Upgrade to CDS 9 - Currently blocked inside Jira as we are waiting for the new version of CDS to be released.
- [EASA-219] no restrictions on UAS and UASModels - *Reopened this Issue to add missing tests to separate Issue [[EASA-219]](https://github.tools.sap/easa/easa-repif/pull/104)*
- [EASA-352] Basic READ OAT field remarkEveryting (PRIV-0I is not shown in the basic-data service
